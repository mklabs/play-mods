## Integrating Play! framework with jQuery UI Grid - Ajax Datasource


This Play! app uses an inner crud-grid play! module that takes care of all assets (js/css) related to the jQuery UI Grid widget. This experiment is heavily inspired by [Integrating Play framework with jQuery DataTables](//www.lunatech-research.com/archives/2011/01/28/playframework-jquery-datatables) and [Ajax DataTables with the Play framework](//www.lunatech-research.com/archives/2011/02/07/ajax-datatables-playframework) articles from [Lunatech Research](//www.lunatech-research.com/editorials/tags/play). This app is a slight variation to use the new UI Grid widget.
